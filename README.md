## Objective :
The goal of this project is to improve revenue of online Retail Company and produce recommendations for its marketing and sales teams.

In this project, i’ll will work with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic.

## SQL FUNCTION :
SQL functions that I used in this project:

* Aggregate functions: These functions facilitate the calculation of values across multiple rows of data, including operations like sum, average, and count.
* Date functions: These functions provide the means to manipulate and extract information from date columns within the database.
* Join functions: These functions empower me to merge data from different tables based on shared columns.
* Union functions: These functions permit the merging of outcomes from various queries into a single result set.
* CTE (Common Table Expression): This function empowers me to establish a temporary result set within a SELECT statement.
* Subqueries: These represent SELECT statements executed within another SELECT statement.
* Window functions: These functions empower me to conduct calculations across a group of rows.
